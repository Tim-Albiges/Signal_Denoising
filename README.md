# Signal_Denoising
The book starts off with creating a signal and applying random noise to it.
I then applied a moving-mean filter to the noisy signal before plotting the noise, filtered and signal.
I then compare filter sizes and the R^2 values.
Then I looked at Smoothing a new noisy signal with use of Convolution with Gaussian kernel.
Followed by examining the gaussian kernel, of different sizes (k) and width (Sigma).
The smoothing gaussian convolution reduced noise well.
Looking at filtering Transients in signals with use of mean and median filters. Used a histogram plot and found the standard diviation to filter m
noise. Though, some tranients are still in the filtered signal, there is a large amount of noise filteres.
